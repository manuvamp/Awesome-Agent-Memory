"""Check that the Open-Source products section of README.md is ordered by GitHub stars.

Parses the numbered entries (each carries a shields.io star badge identifying its
owner/repo), fetches live star counts from the GitHub API, and reports any entry
that is out of descending order. Exits non-zero if a re-sort is needed, so the
scheduled workflow notifies maintainers.

Also checks the 100-star boundary of the collapsed "Emerging projects" details
block: entries in the main list should have >= 100 stars and emerging entries
< 100. A grace band (main >= 90 passes, emerging < 110 passes) stops projects
hovering around 100 from flip-flopping between sections every week.

Indented sub-items (`    - **[Name](...)**`, e.g. a drop-in replacement nested
under the product it replaces) are unranked by convention: they are parsed and
listed under their parent but excluded from both checks. A star badge that no
numbered entry or sub-item claims is reported as an error so nothing can be
skipped silently.

Usage: GITHUB_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/check_star_order.py [README.md]

To apply the ordering this script suggests, run its companion fixer:
GITHUB_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/fix_star_order.py README.md --write
